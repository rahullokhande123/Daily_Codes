Create a class named Message.Use function overloading and create a function mymessage()
with no parameter and with string parameter, if nothing is passed to it,
then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed.
If some String is passed to it as a parameter, then in place of "programming languages"
the name of that String variable should be printed.
For example, if we pass "cpp", then "I love cpp" should be printed.
